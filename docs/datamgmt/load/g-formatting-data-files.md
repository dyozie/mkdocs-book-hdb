When you use the HAWQ tools for loading and unloading data, you must specify how your data is formatted. `COPY`, `CREATE             EXTERNAL TABLE, `and `hawq load` have clauses that allow you to specify how your data is formatted. Data can be delimited text (`TEXT`) or comma separated values (`CSV`) format. External data must be formatted correctly to be read by HAWQ. This topic explains the format of data files expected by HAWQ.
